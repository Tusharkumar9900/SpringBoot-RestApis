# Spring Boot REST APIs

This repository includes the code for REST APIs built using the Spring Boot framework in Java. 

## Overview

The project demonstrates a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. The key components of the project are:

1. **Model**: Defines the data structure and business logic.
2. **View**: Not applicable for REST APIs, but usually represents the presentation layer in a web application.
3. **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate service calls to process the data.

After implementing the basic CRUD operations, the project extends to expose these operations as REST APIs, enabling interaction with the application through HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Model**: Defines the entity classes and their relationships.
- **Repository**: Manages database operations using Spring Data JPA.
- **Service**: Implements business logic and interacts with the repository layer.
- **Controller**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exception handling for better error management.
- **Validation**: Data validation using annotations.
